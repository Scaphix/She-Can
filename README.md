Name of the Project: Dinosaurs-Kids-Club

Dinosaurs-Kids-Club is an Online-Science-Club for children (and their parents) who are interested in dinosaurs and fossils. It´s an exciting place for kids to have fun, play and learn everything about dinosaurs, their history and about fossils. Parents can sign-up and will receive a weekly newsletter with cool stories about dinos, instructions for handicrafts, bedtime-stories and similiar. We host volunteerly teaching scientist who´re doing a monthly online lesson about dino-topics. Once a year we´re organising an excursion, this could be the visit of a museum, an archeological site or a dino-adventure-park. Every member is receiving a monthly surprise gift inside a dino egg. The surprise box can contain, dino games or toys. 
In this section, you will include a few paragraphs providing an overview of your project.

## UX

I started designing the about-us page, by thinking about what is most important for the user on the first view and how can the benefit of using the site be displayed most efficiently. Afterwards I designed a color-scheme and placed the elements in an appealing way. I added the content I was thinking about and some interactive elements. Afterwards I created the sign-up page, and the meet the dinosaurs page, which should give the user some idea what to expect from full access to the member section and deliver some knowledge about the the topic of the page.

### Colour Scheme

- `#7D3E00` used for primary text.
- `#E2F6B9` used for primary background.
- `#FFFFFF` used for secondary text.
- `rgb(190, 4, 4)` used for secondary highlights.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/7d3e00-e2f6b9-ffffff-be0404) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography

- [Oswald](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oswald) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer and the icon at the sign-up form.
