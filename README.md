# SheCAN Self-defence center for women
## The purpose with this project

Name of the Project: SheCAN
Empower Women Through Self-Defense

Our self-defense center is dedicated to empowering women with the knowledge, skills, and confidence they need to protect themselves in everyday situations. We believe that every woman has the right to feel safe and strong, whether walking alone, commuting, or navigating public or private environments. Through expert-led training, we aim to make self-defense accessible, practical, and tailored to real-life scenarios.

We offer a range of training options to suit every lifestyle and need. Whether you’re looking for one-on-one personal training, dynamic group classes, or specialized corporate sessions, our programs are designed with flexibility and professionalism in mind. Each course is led by certified instructors who create a supportive, respectful, and inclusive environment where women can learn at their own pace.

Our mission goes beyond physical training — it’s about building a community that encourages mental strength, confidence, and awareness. With our self-defense center, women don’t just learn to react — they learn to prevent, to stay aware, and to carry themselves with assurance wherever they go. Join us and take the first step toward a safer, more empowered life.

## UX/the design

I started thinking about header of my pages content where I wanted a powerful video /photos to clearly indicate the purpose of the webpage. Tha main porpose and a call to action clearly showed indicat to the user where they can enroll for the next course. 
Afterwards I started to think about a Icon and name that would suit my porpose. Then I started thinking about the layout and the color-scheme I wanted. Lastly I added the content I wanted  


### Colour Scheme

- `black` used for primary text.
- `#444` used for secondary text.
- `rgb(190, 4, 4)` used for primary highlights.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/7d3e00-e2f6b9-ffffff-be0404) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography

- [Anton](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Anton) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Oswald](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oswald) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer and the icon at the sign-up form.
